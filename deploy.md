# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

The deployment was failing due to TypeScript compilation errors. The following issues were resolved:

1. **Unused imports and variables** - Removed unused imports and variables that were causing TypeScript errors
2. **Type issues in chart component** - Fixed type annotations for the chart tooltip and legend components
3. **Calendar component props** - Removed unused props from calendar icon components
4. **Build optimization** - Added manual chunk splitting to reduce bundle size

## Configuration Files Updated

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

### vite.config.ts
Added build optimization with manual chunk splitting:
```typescript
build: {
  outDir: 'dist',
  sourcemap: false,
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
        router: ['react-router-dom'],
        ui: ['@radix-ui/react-icons', 'lucide-react'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Local Build Test**: Run `npm run build` to ensure the build succeeds locally
2. **Commit Changes**: Commit all changes to your repository
3. **Push to Vercel**: Push to your main branch or trigger a new deployment
4. **Monitor Build**: Check the Vercel build logs for any issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### TypeScript Errors
- Run `npm run build` locally to catch TypeScript errors before deployment
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Fix type annotations for components

### Routing Issues
- Ensure `vercel.json` has proper SPA routing configuration
- All routes should redirect to `index.html`

### Build Size Warnings
- Use manual chunk splitting to reduce bundle size
- Consider code splitting for large components
- Optimize imports to reduce bundle size

## Performance Optimization

The build now includes:
- Manual chunk splitting for better caching
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Proper SPA routing configuration
- TypeScript compilation without errors
